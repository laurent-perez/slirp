This README briefly describes SLIRP and how to install and use it.
	
SLIRP is a vectorizing code generator, aimed primarily at simplifying
the process of creating modules for the S-Lang scripting language. It
can dramatically reduce the time and effort required to make C, C++,
and Fortran code callable directly from the S-Lang interpreter,
automatically vectorize functions to take advantage of the powerful
numerical and array capabilities native to S-Lang, and even generate
Makefiles to automate the build process.  Another distinguishing feature,
of special interest as multiprocessor and multicore desktops become
more prevalent, is that SLIRP can generate parallelizable wrappers
for OpenMP-aware compilers.

Before building SLIRP you will need

   1.  The S-Lang interpreter library (http://www.jedsoft.org/slang/)
   2.  A C compiler
   3.  And, optionally, C++ and Fortran compilers

After unpacking SLIRP, a build sequence usually consists of three steps:

   1.  configure the distribution
   2.  build it
   3.  install it

For example, a standard Linux build would look like

   linux%  cd <your_unpacked_slirp_distribution>
   linux%  ./configure
   linux%  make
   linux%  make install

Here S-Lang will be searched for in default locations and SLIRP
will be built & installed accordingly.  Depending upon the speed of
your computer, this process typically takes only a minute or two to
complete.

If you are unfamiliar with the configure/make/install process, or
would like to customize your build and installation, or are
experiencing build problems, run

  ./configure --help

to see what options are available.

For example, while S-Lang is usually installed to /usr/local by default
let's suppose you have it installed in a non-standard location like

		/nfs/cxc/a1/i686
		
which the SLIRP configure script cannot find on its own;  in this case
you can explicitly specify the location of S-Lang with

  ./configure --with-slang=/nfs/cxc/a1/i686 ...

Two other important configure options are --prefix and --exec-prefix,
which let you customize where SLIRP -- and modules that it generates -- 
will be installed.  By default these will be installed in subdirectories
relative to where S-Lang was found, namely

   Binary Files (dynamically loadable shared objects)

   	$prefix/lib/slang/modules/           SLang 1
	$prefix/lib/slang/v2/modules/        SLang 2

   Human Readable Files (such as .sl scripts)

	$exec_prefix/share/slsh/local-packages/

For example, to set the value of $prefix to /home/bill, use

   ./configure --prefix=/home/bill ...

When configure is finished it's a good idea to inspect the Makefile
that it generated, and make any final customizations.  Then, as shown
above, building and installing SLIRP should involve nothing more than:

   make

followed by

   make install

although you may need root privileges to perform the last step.
