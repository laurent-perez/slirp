.SH NAME
slirpsh \- S-Lang shell endowed with SLIRP annotation capabilities
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBslirpsh\fR [ \fBOPTIONS\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This program should not be explicitly invoked by users.  Instead, it
should be accessed implicitly from within the slirp wrapper script.
.PP
\fBslirpsh\fR is S-Lang shell endowed with a custom file loader that gives it
the ability to recognize SLIRP annotations.  SLIRP is the (SL)ang
(I)nterface (P)ackage, a code generator aimed primarily at simplifying
the process of creating modules for the S-Lang scripting language.
.PP
SLIRP can dramatically reduce the time and effort required to make
C, C++, or Fortran code callable directly from the S-Lang interpreter,
and will even generate Makefiles to automate the build process.
.SH "OPTIONS"

.nf
  As noted above, this program should not be explicitly invoked by users.
