Each function was invoked N times (default==20) for each input size; the
largest and smallest runtimes were discarded, and the rest were averaged
to yield each entry in the .dat files.

-O2 and -xO2 (Solaris) optimizations were employed for the SLIRP
generated code, as well for S-Lang proper.  Always make sure that
everything you are comparing has been compiled with the same
optimization flags!!!!


Example:

% isis-script ../../perform.sl sin
# SLIRP vectorization benchmark data
# Generated: Fri May 25 16:04:56 2007
# Command:   isis ../../perform.sl sin
# Number of Iterations (func invocations) per array size: 20
# System:    svoboda (i686 Linux)
 
# Elements      sin             vsin
